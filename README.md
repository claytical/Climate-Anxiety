Attention Based Narrative for Story Matter Hackathon (https://tribecafilminstitute.org/events/detail/tribeca_hacks_story_matter)

This code allows you to create non-linear branching narratives that change based on OSC messages over time. The code right now is in hackathon state. Work will be done to make it a bit easier for non-coders to use this software to create stories.

In order to compile the code, you'll need to use openFrameworks .80 (http://openframeworks.cc/download/)
